Idea 1: Instructional cooking video results based on ingredients searched in Food & Recipe API. Users will also be able to filter out recipes that fit with their current ingredients at home, allergies, diet preferences, etc. 
  APIs:
    -Recipes based on ingredient search: https://www.programmableweb.com/api/food-rest-api-v10 
    -Search for YouTube video based on recipe results: https://www.programmableweb.com/api/youtube/developers 

Idea 2: Translate Youtube Comments by using a translator API to auto scan for unknown languages to the user. Could be used to understand discussion of videos that themselves may be already translated, but the comments below were not.
